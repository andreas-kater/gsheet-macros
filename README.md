# gsheet-macros

This repo contains all of my favourite Google Sheet macros that I use all the
time.

It was inspired by WOJCIECH SKOWRONEK's [great article](https://www.toptal.com/google-docs/extending-google-sheets-app-scripts) on using clasp to write your Google Sheets macros in your favourite editor.

How to link macros to keyboard shortcuts is explained [here](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets/macros#manifest_structure_for_macros).
